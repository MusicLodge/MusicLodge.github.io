We live in a beautiful region which lends itself to multiple sporting interests in all seasons, including numerous bike paths joining [Annecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annecy) with outlying villages to as far as [Albertville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertville).  The old town of [Annecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annecy) or "Le vieil Annecy"  is famous for its meandering canals and idyllic picture-postcard scenes, and [lake Annecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Annecy) is famous for its clean waters surrounded by numerous beaches. [Annecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annecy) is just over 40 kms from [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva) and 100 kms from [Mont Blanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc), with many more mountains to climb, ski and explore in between!



Our own village of [Giez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giez) is quiet and is famous for its [18-hole and 9-hole golf courses](https://golfdegiez.com/).  Our house is situated in the historic part of town, overlooking the golf course and overlooked by its still privately owned medieval chateau.  We are nevertheless quite well connected by public transport to both Annecy in one direction, and to [Albertville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertville) in the opposite direction, and cycle path at the bottom of our road.



Having had 5 children at home, we have a large house with 5 double bedrooms, 4 bathrooms (including a sauna), large playroom and music room at the top of the house which can be converted into additional sleeping arrangements (when the house has needed to sleep 16 adults), a large sitting room with a concert grand piano on the ground floor, with adjacent dining room, library, fully equipped kitchen, laundry.  There’s also an extensive cellar and garden with patio for barbeques and outdoor eating.



Summers are hot while winters are cold.  The mountains change their colours according to the season; nature changes visibly with every cycle of life, yet life’s rhythm is reliably constant.
