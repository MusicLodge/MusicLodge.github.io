I have worked on many translations. 
These include translating large and complex documents, often used with a specific language, such as in legal documents, civil engineering projects, simultaneous live translations in court hearings and at the notary, for example.

Pricing depends on the complexity of the translation and urgency, and also whether it is from written documents or live translations.  For written translations a quotation is based on the number of words in the document, the time calculated needed, particularly when research may be required and when time needs to be spent on customising English and turning ideas into the best way marketing approach to reach customers.
