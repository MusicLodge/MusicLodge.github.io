Wanting something a bit more immersive? 
Are you moving abroad to work or study but a bit worried of breaking the ice with English language and to feel more at ease speaking everyday English? 


# Residential courses <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/anotherpictureplease.png" width="300" height="100" hspace="30">

Residential courses from beginner to advanced.  Maximum of 3 people per level.  Intensive programme during 3 days with morning and afternoon lessons (9 am to 12 am and 2 pm to 5 pm), accommodation and full board with 3 meals daily, spoken English required at all times.  

Longer stays of one week and more, which would include a minimum of 3 hours of English lessons per day and also other activities and/or visits to suit the student:

My husband writes and plays music and is also a wonderful cook (check out [Peter’s daily cooking blog](GiezFoodie.github.io) to see some of his exciting and trusted menus and recipes).

We are also happy to accept holidaymakers, both French and English visitors, who wish to have a good English breakfast before starting out on their day’s walk in the mountains.  Packed lunches can also be provided and assistance with preparing and embarking on your visits or walks.  You can plan your vacation with friends to stay under the same roof and return in the evening to a cooked dinner, to play cards, to have English or French conversation.
