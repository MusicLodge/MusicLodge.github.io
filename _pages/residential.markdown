Wanting something a bit more immersive? 
Are you moving abroad to work or study but a bit worried of breaking the ice with English language and to feel more at ease speaking everyday English? 


# Residential courses <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/anotherpictureplease.png" width="300" height="100">

Residential courses from beginner to advanced.  Maximum of 3 people per level.  Intensive programme during 3 days with morning and afternoon lessons (9 am to 12 am and 2 am to 5 pm), accommodation and full board with 3 meals daily, spoken English required at all times.  

Longer stays of one week and more, which would include a minimum of 3 hours of English lessons per day and also other activities and/or visits to suit the student: 
- English etiquette and English customs
- outdoor sport in nature and/or cultural visits  
- viniculture, wine appreciation
- music, practice and recordings
- cooking

My husband writes and plays music and is also a wonderful cook (see Peter’s daily cooking bog to see some of his exciting and trusted menus and recipes).
